# Roach-Motel
Zap roaches and other pests with high voltage.
This device generates a series of 600 volt pulses running on a 9 volt battery.  It features a large area of interleaved power and ground lines.

An ATtiny85 generates critically timed pulses that cause a 10 millihenry inductor to produce short high voltages spikes that are accumulated on a .02 microfarad capacitor.
